# CHUNGA CASH APP

The Chunga Cash App is an Android application designed to help manage pocket money for students in Kenyan boarding high schools and primary boarding schools. The app aims to address issues of money theft and mismanagement by providing a secure and organized platform for students and the school administrations.

## Problem Statement

In Kenyan boarding schools, students often carry pocket money to buy snacks and essentials from the school canteen. However, not all students receive pocket money, leading to incidents of theft and mismanagement. The school administration stores students' pocket money, but the process lacks proper identification and security measures.

## Solution

The Chunga Cash App solves this problem by providing a digital platform for both students and the school administration to manage pocket money transactions securely and efficiently.

### Key Features

- **School Administration Account**: The Admin is the main user of the app. They can register students and manage their accounts.

- **Student Registration**: Students can register by providing their name, admission number, face photo, 4 digit password, account balance, and class details.

- **Secure Transactions**: Students set a 4-digit password to access their account balance and transaction details. This ensures that only the rightful owner can access their account information.

- **Transaction History**: The app maintains a record of all transactions, making it easy for students and the school administration to track money inflows and outflows.
